This app merges two or more .pkg files that originally existed as one file, but were split.

I've tested the functionality of this app multiple times, and it works, but if you have any issues, just let me know, and I will try to work it out as fast as I can.

This is my first app ever... and I don't know how any of this stuff works. I would greatly appreciate any tips on how to make the app more presentable.
I made a cool icon for the app and everything, but I couldn't figure out how to implement it so I just scrapped it.
